    "# Suicide Rates, case study.\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population, and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective of this case study is to find the patterns for increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socioeconomic spectrum by using exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "We will be using the dataset about suicide rates from 1985 to 2016. This dataset has the following attributes:"
